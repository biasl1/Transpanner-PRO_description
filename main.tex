\section*{Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)}

\subsection*{Installation}
\section*{Transpanner 2 Product Page Description}

\subsection*{Category}
FX, 3D audio

\subsection*{Compatibility}
Mac (Intel/M1/M2): macOS 10.11 and newer
Windows (x64): Windows 10 and newer

\subsection*{Features}
\textbf{1: Angle}: adjust the thumb angle to position sound in the 3D stereo field
\textbf{2: Distance}: depth is obtained by moving the thumb inwards toward the center of the polar pad
\textbf{3: Gain}: this parameter sets the gain of the far field
\textbf{4: Input}: choose the input to be mono or stereo

\subsection*{What Makes This Plugin Unique?}
When you adjust the controls in Transpanner 2, it tailors these sound wave properties in such a way that your brain is tricked into perceiving the sound as coming from different directions, including from behind you. This creates a 3D audio effect, enveloping you in a more lifelike and immersive sound environment, all from a stereo setup.

\subsection*{Keywords}


\subsection*{Usage Instructions}
Place it on a stereo track and move the thumb across the pad to create immersive sound placement in 3D space.
